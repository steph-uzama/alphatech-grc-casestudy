# AlphaTech ‚Äì Simulated GRC Casestudy

A comprehensive Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) simulation project designed to demonstrate hands-on experience in building and managing an Information Security Management System (ISMS) for a fictional U.S-based healthcare technology company, **AlphaTech**.  

This project integrates multiple frameworks, including **ISO/IEC 27001:2022**, **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**, **ISO 22301**, and **ISO 27701** to simulate how a real organization develops, implements and maintains its security and compliance posture.


### üß© **Project Overview**
The AlphaTech GRC program reflects the end-to-end lifecycle of information security and compliance management.  
It was developed to:
- Establish governance structures and security policies.  
- Identify, assess and treat information security risks.  
- Implement business continuity and incident response frameworks.  
- Enforce vendor and third-party risk management.  
- Embed data protection and privacy practices aligned with U.S. privacy regulations.  
- Monitor, measure and report on ISMS performance.  

Each section mirrors real-world deliverables and documentation practices used by GRC professionals in enterprise environments.
